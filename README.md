# Java Grid-Based Game Simulation

This project is a console-based Java game simulation developed to practice core object-oriented programming concepts such as abstraction, polymorphism, and state management.

## Project Overview
The application models a two-dimensional game board populated by multiple tokens. Each token follows a distinct movement strategy and interacts with the board independently. The game continues until only one active token remains, at which point a winner is declared.

## Key Features
- Two-dimensional board system for tracking token positions and game state
- Abstract token class with movement behavior implemented through subclassing
- Polymorphic design allowing multiple token movement strategies
- Console-based visualization of board updates and gameplay progression
- Automated winner detection based on active token state

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Abstract Classes and Polymorphism
- Console-based application design

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in a Java-compatible IDE
3. Run `FunkyGameDemo.java` to start the simulation
